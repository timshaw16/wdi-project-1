# wdi-project-1
My first WDI project

Follow The Flash!

This game uses a combination of JavaScript, jQuery, HTML & CSS.

The player will have to click on the start button to start the game. The computer will randomlly generates 3 flash sequences. The player will then have to click on the circles that flashed. There are a number of levels to the this game which an extra sequence being added to each level.

I first created my HMTL boiler plate and added the ul and lis and two divs for the ‘start’ & ‘reset’ buttons.

After this, I then went on to tackle the JavaScript. Firstly creating the lets to make them global.


Created the empty arrays for the game and user sequence
