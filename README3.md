WDI-Project-1
#This was my first WDI projectFollow The Flash!####IntroductionFollow The Flash! is a one player memory game loosely based on Simon Says. This was my first project to build on the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly using JavaScript, jQuery, HTML & CSS.You can play this game online now at http://www.tjshaw.co.uk/ga/followtheflash####How to playWhen the player enters the site they will be presented with 6 circles and a ‘start’ & ‘reset’ button. To the start the game the player simply presses the ‘start’ button to start the flashes.The computer will randomly flash 3 circles and the player will have to the follow the sequences. If the player gets them right they move on to the next level. Each level an extra flash will appear.	####Project Brief1.
